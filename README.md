üí¨#Interface_ChatbotBBO ‚Äî GovernCardanoBot Integration Template for n8n

GovernCardanoBot is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide clear and accurate answers related to the Cardano blockchain and its governance system. Whether you're an investor or a tech enthusiast, it helps you stay informed and engaged with Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem and decision-making processes.

To make this system accessible to users with limited programming experience, we've developed a ready-to-use interface template for n8n, focusing on reusability, fast deployment, and minimal coding requirements. This solution simplifies the development of governance-related chatbots and supports integration with external services.


#üß∞ Prerequisites

üñ•Ô∏è Server Requirements

- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu recommended)

- Minimum Specs: 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD

üîß Software & Tools

- Docker & Docker Compose

- SSH access to your server

- A domain name (for HTTPS and production readiness)

- PostgreSQL server or Supabase

- Local AI models (e.g., LLaMA or similar). Alternatively, you may integrate external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, etc.)

- Telegram Bot (via BotFather)

- Cardano API (e.g., Koios ‚Äî free tier supported)

- Integration with Google Sheets/Docs API, if needed


#üß† Recommended Technical Skills

- To deploy and customize the chatbot effectively, users should have a basic understanding of:

- System architecture and workflow automation

- Basic coding (in Python, C#, Java, etc.)

- Using Docker and Docker Compose

- Managing servers via SSH and configuring domain names

- Working with databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, etc.)

- Backend/API fundamentals

- Familiarity with tools such as n8n, Telegram Bots, and Google API Services


#üöÄ Setup & Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the GovernCardanoBot interface template on your server:

1. Provision a Linux-based VPS/server

2. Set up SSH access

3. Purchase and configure a domain, pointing it to your server IP

4. Install Docker & Docker Compose
‚Üí Official guide: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

5. Deploy n8n via Docker
You can use a basic docker-compose.yml or a production-ready version with SSL and reverse proxy

6.Import the GovernCardanoBot n8n Template
‚Üí You can import it directly through the n8n UI (Settings ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Workflow)

7. Connect third-party APIs:

- Configure API credentials (Telegram Bot, Koios, Google Sheets, etc.)

- Set up database connections (PostgreSQL or Supabase)


#üìÅ Template Highlights

- Pre-built workflows for chatbot interaction

- Integration-ready with Telegram, Koios, AI models, and Google services

- Easily customizable via n8n visual editor

- Focused on governance-related use cases in the Cardano ecosystem

#üîê Security Notes

- Enable Basic Auth for n8n if exposed to the public

- Use HTTPS (via Nginx + Certbot or Cloudflare proxy)

- Keep API keys and environment variables secure

#üß© Extensibility Ideas

- Add multilingual support using AI translation models

- Integrate Discord or Slack bots

- Expand Cardano data sources (e.g., Blockfrost, Cardano GraphQL, etc.)

- Use webhooks for real-time governance notifications
